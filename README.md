# Responsive Starter Site with SASS

Basic starter site with responsive breakpoints, using a modified Twitter Bootstrap grid

## Version 2

Updated to the Bootstrap 3 grid. Read the [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) for grid classes.

## Breakpoint variables

This system is mobile first, so all styles without media queries work from mobile up. For larger screens, the following mixins are used.

+ break(tablet)
+ break(desktop)
+ break(lg-desktop)
+ break(hdpi)
